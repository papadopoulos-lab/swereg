# Overview

This vignette defines the terms used throughout the swereg target trial emulation (TTE) system. It serves as a quick reference for anyone reading or writing code that uses `TTEDesign`, `TTEEnrollment`, or `TTEPlan`.

# Data levels

| Term | Meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
| **skeleton** | Person-week panel created by `create_skeleton()` and enriched with registry data. One row per person per ISO week. Input to the TTE pipeline. Stored as batched `.qs2` files. |
| **person-week** | Synonym for skeleton-level data before enrollment. The `data_level` of a `TTEEnrollment` starts as `"person_week"`. |
| **trial** | After enrollment via `tte_enrollment(..., ratio = )`, data is expanded to trial panels: one row per person per trial per time period. `data_level` becomes `"trial"`. |
| **counting-process** | The trial-level data uses counting-process format with `tstart`/`tstop` columns (Andersen-Gill style), suitable for time-varying Cox models and weighted Poisson regression. |

# Classes

| Class | Role |
|:------|:-----|
| **`TTEDesign`** | Column name mappings that define the trial schema: person ID, exposure, outcome, confounder, and time variables. Created once via `tte_design()` and reused across the workflow. |
| **`TTEEnrollment`** | Enrollment data container (data.table + design + workflow state). Methods modify in-place via R6 reference semantics and return `invisible(self)` for `$`-chaining. |
| **`TTEPlan`** | Builder for trial generation. Holds the ETT grid, skeleton file paths, and per-ETT design parameters. Orchestrates Loop 1 via `$generate_enrollments_and_ipw()`. |

# ETT grid

| Term | Meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
| **ETT** (Emulated Target Trial) | One combination of outcome × follow-up duration × age group. Each ETT produces one analysis-ready dataset. Corresponds to one row in `plan$ett`. |
| **enrollment_id** | Groups ETTs that share the same trial panels. ETTs within an `enrollment_id` have the same age group and matching design parameters (confounders, exposure, eligibility). They differ only in outcome and/or follow-up duration. |
| **ett_id** | Unique identifier for a single ETT (e.g., `"ETT01"`). Auto-assigned sequentially by `$add_one_ett()`. |
| **enrollment_spec** | The metadata list returned by `plan$enrollment_spec(i)`. Contains `design` (`TTEDesign`), `enrollment_id`, `age_range`, and `n_threads`. Passed to the `process_fn` callback during Loop 1. |

# Two-loop architecture

## Loop 1: enrollment + IPW

One iteration per `enrollment_id`. Run by `plan$generate_enrollments_and_ipw()`:

```
skeleton files ──(parallel callr workers)──► enroll
  ──► rbind ──► collapse ──► impute ──► IPW + truncate ──► save
```

Produces two files per enrollment_id:

- **file_raw** — post-enrollment, pre-imputation
- **file_imp** — post-imputation + IPW (input to Loop 2)

## Loop 2: per-ETT outcome weighting

One iteration per ETT. Runs sequentially in the main process:

```
load file_imp ──► $prepare_for_analysis() ──► save file_analysis
```

`$prepare_for_analysis()` combines outcome preparation and IPCW-PP into one call. It prepares outcome data, calculates IPCW-PP, combines weights (`ipw × ipcw_pp` → `analysis_weight_pp`), truncates, and drops intermediate IPCW columns.

## process_fn callback

User-supplied function with signature `function(enrollment_spec, file_path)`. Called once per skeleton file per enrollment_id inside Loop 1. Responsible for:

1. Eligibility checks (age, calendar time, exclusion criteria)
2. Exposure definition
3. Enrollment via `tte_enrollment(..., ratio = )`

Each invocation runs in a fresh R subprocess (`callr::r_bg()`) to avoid fork + OpenMP segfault issues with data.table.

# Weights

| Term | Meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
| **IPW** (Inverse Probability of treatment Weighting) | Baseline confounding adjustment. Computed once per enrollment_id in Loop 1 via `$ipw()`. |
| **IPCW-PP** (Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting, Per-Protocol) | Time-varying weight for per-protocol analysis. Accounts for treatment switching and loss to follow-up. Computed per ETT in Loop 2 via `$prepare_for_analysis()`. |
| **analysis_weight_pp** | Final combined weight (`ipw × ipcw_pp`), truncated. Created automatically by `$prepare_for_analysis()`. |
| **truncation** | Winsorization of extreme weights at the 1st and 99th percentiles (by default) to reduce variance. Applied via `$truncate()`. |

# File naming

All output files live in the project-specific data directory.

| Column in `plan$ett` | Pattern | When created |
|:---------------------|:--------|:-------------|
| `file_raw` | `{prefix}_raw_{enrollment_id}.qs2` | Loop 1 (intermediate) |
| `file_imp` | `{prefix}_imp_{enrollment_id}.qs2` | Loop 1 (output) |
| `file_analysis` | `{prefix}_analysis_{ett_id}.qs2` | Loop 2 (output) |

# Variable prefixes

| Prefix | Convention |
|:-------|:-----------|
| `x_` | Loop iteration variables extracted from grid tables (e.g., `x_outcome`, `x_follow_up`, `x_file_analysis`). Used in generate and analysis scripts to distinguish loop variables from dataset columns. |
| `rd_` | Row-dependent variables (e.g., `rd_age_continuous`, `rd_exposed`). Variables that can change value across rows (time points) for the same person. Counterpart of row-independent (`rowind`) variables that are time-invariant. |
