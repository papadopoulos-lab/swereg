# Introduction

In longitudinal registry data analysis with swereg, variables can be classified into two fundamental types:

- **rowdep** (row-dependent): Variables that can change over time for a person
- **rowind** (row-independent): Variables that cannot change over time for a person

Understanding this distinction is crucial for effective analysis of Swedish registry data, particularly during the `skeleton2_clean` phase where many transformations convert `rowdep` variables into `rowind` variables.

# The concept

## Row-dependent (rowdep) variables

These variables can have different values across time periods for the same person:

- **Education level** (`rowdep_edu_cat`): A person's education can improve over time
- **Income** (`rowdep_income_inflation_adjusted`): Income changes annually
- **Had diagnosis this week** (`diag_gd_icd10_F64_089`): TRUE/FALSE depending on the specific week
- **Current age** (`age`): Increases continuously over time

## Row-independent (rowind) variables  

These variables have the same value across all time periods for a person:

- **Age at first diagnosis** (`rowind_age_first_gd`): Fixed once the diagnosis occurs
- **Year of first diagnosis** (`rowind_isoyear_first_gd`): Fixed historical fact
- **Birth country** (`rowind_birthcountry`): Never changes
- **Register classification** (`rowind_register_tag`): Person's role in the study (case, control, etc.)
- **Age at death** (`rowind_age_death`): Fixed once death occurs

# Why this matters

In longitudinal data, you often need to:

1. **Identify when something first happened** (e.g., first diagnosis, first prescription)
2. **Capture characteristics at specific time points** (e.g., education level when first diagnosed)
3. **Create person-level summaries** that don't vary by time period

Converting `rowdep` → `rowind` allows you to create stable, person-level characteristics for analysis.

# Common transformation patterns

## Pattern 1: First occurrence transformations

The most common transformation finds the first time a condition is TRUE and extracts a value from that time point. This works for any condition - time-based, value-based, or complex combinations.

### Time-based conditions

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Age at first GD diagnosis for AFAB individuals
make_rowind_first_occurrence(skeleton_gd,
                            condition = "diag_gd_icd10_F64_089 == TRUE & is_amab == FALSE",
                            value_var = "age", 
                            new_var = "rowind_age_first_gd_afab")

# Education level at time of first diagnosis
make_rowind_first_occurrence(skeleton_gd,
                            condition = "isoyear == rowind_isoyear_first_gd",
                            value_var = "rowdep_edu_cat", 
                            new_var = "rowind_edu_at_first_dx")
```

### Manual approach (for understanding)

```{r eval=FALSE}
# The helper function does this automatically:
skeleton_gd[diag_gd_icd10_F64_089 == TRUE & is_amab == FALSE, temp := age]
skeleton_gd[, rowind_age_first_gd_afab := swereg::first_non_na(temp), by = .(id)]
skeleton_gd[, temp := NULL]  # Always clean up temp variable
```

## Pattern 2: Simple renaming (already rowind)

When variables are already row-independent but need consistent naming:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# If date of birth is truly the same for all rows (as it should be)
setnames(skeleton_gd, "dob", "rowind_dob")

# If birth country was added from demographics (already person-level)
setnames(skeleton_gd, "birth_country", "rowind_birth_country")
```

**Important**: Only use this when the variable is genuinely the same across all rows for each person. If values differ, you have a data integration problem to fix first.

# Practical example with fake data

Let's demonstrate these concepts using the fake datasets included in swereg:

```{r}
# Load fake data
data("fake_demographics")
data("fake_inpatient_diagnoses")

# Create a small skeleton for demonstration
ids <- fake_demographics$lopnr[1:5]
skeleton <- create_skeleton(ids, "2020-01-01", "2020-03-31")

# Add demographic data (creates rowind variables)
swereg::make_lowercase_names(fake_demographics, date_columns = "DodDatum")
add_onetime(skeleton, fake_demographics, "lopnr")

# Add diagnosis data (creates rowdep variables)
swereg::make_lowercase_names(fake_inpatient_diagnoses, date_columns = "INDATUM")
add_diagnoses(skeleton, fake_inpatient_diagnoses, "lopnr", 
              diags = list("f64_diag" = "^F64"))

# Examine the structure
print("Skeleton structure:")
head(skeleton[id == ids[1]], 8)
```

Now let's create rowind variables:

```{r}
# Example 1: ISO year of first F64 diagnosis  
make_rowind_first_occurrence(skeleton,
                            condition = "f64_diag == TRUE",
                            value_var = "isoyear", 
                            new_var = "rowind_isoyear_first_f64")

# Example 2: ISO year-week of first F64 diagnosis
make_rowind_first_occurrence(skeleton,
                            condition = "f64_diag == TRUE",
                            value_var = "isoyearweek", 
                            new_var = "rowind_isoyearweek_first_f64")

# View results
print("Results with rowind variables:")
head(skeleton[id == ids[1], .(id, isoyear, isoyearweek, f64_diag, 
                              rowind_isoyear_first_f64, rowind_isoyearweek_first_f64)], 8)
```

Notice how:
- `f64_diag` varies by week (rowdep)
- `rowind_isoyear_first_f64` and `rowind_isoyearweek_first_f64` are constant for each person (rowind)

# Best practices

## 1. Naming conventions

Use clear prefixes to distinguish variable types:
- `rowdep_*` for time-varying variables
- `rowind_*` for time-invariant variables

## 2. Always clean up temporary variables

When using manual transformations, always remove temp variables:

```{r eval=FALSE}
skeleton[condition == TRUE, temp := value]
skeleton[, new_rowind_var := first_non_na(temp), by = .(id)]
skeleton[, temp := NULL]  # Critical: clean up
```

## 3. Use helper functions when possible

The `make_rowind_first_occurrence()` function handles temp variable management automatically and reduces errors.

## 4. Validate your transformations

Always check that your rowind variables are actually row-independent:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# This should return 1 for all persons (meaning all rows have same value)
skeleton[, .(unique_values = uniqueN(rowind_isoyear_first_f64)), by = .(id)]
```

# Integration with swereg workflow

The rowdep/rowind concept fits into the standard swereg workflow:

1. **skeleton1_create**: Focus on data integration, creates mostly rowdep variables
2. **skeleton2_clean**: Heavy focus on rowdep → rowind transformations  
3. **skeleton3_analyze**: Work with clean rowind variables for analysis

The `skeleton2_clean` phase is where most rowdep → rowind transformations occur, as you prepare stable person-level characteristics for downstream analysis.

# Conclusion

Understanding the distinction between rowdep and rowind variables is fundamental to effective longitudinal registry data analysis. The transformation patterns shown here, especially when combined with helper functions like `make_rowind_first_occurrence()`, make it easier to create robust, analysis-ready datasets from complex Swedish registry data.
