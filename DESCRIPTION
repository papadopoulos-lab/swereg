Description: Provides a comprehensive framework for manipulating and analyzing Swedish 
    healthcare registry data in epidemiological research. Creates longitudinal data 
    skeletons with ISO year-week structure and integrates multiple Swedish health 
    registries including specialist healthcare (NPR), prescription drugs (LMED), 
    causes of death, and surgical procedures. Optimized for efficient processing 
    of large registry datasets using data.table.
