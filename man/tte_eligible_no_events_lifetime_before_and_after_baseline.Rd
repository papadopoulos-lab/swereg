\title{Check eligibility based on no events ever (person-level, before and after baseline)}
\usage{
tte_eligible_no_events_lifetime_before_and_after_baseline(
  dt,
  event_var,
  col_name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data.table with an `id` column and the specified event variable.}

\item{event_var}{Character. Name of a logical column indicating event
occurrence.}

\item{col_name}{Character or NULL. Name of the eligibility column to create.
If NULL, auto-generates as
"eligible_no_<event_var>_lifetime_before_and_after_baseline".}
}
\value{
The input data.table (invisibly), modified by reference with the new
  eligibility column.
}
\description{
Adds a logical column indicating whether the person has NO TRUE values in the
specified event variable at ANY time point. Unlike
[tte_eligible_no_events_in_window_excluding_wk0()] which checks a rolling
window relative to each week, this is a person-level flag: if the event is
TRUE at any row for a person, ALL rows for that person are marked ineligible.
}
\details{
Use case: excluding people with a condition diagnosed at any time (e.g.,
gender dysphoria F64) where future diagnoses also indicate the person
should never have been eligible.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Exclude anyone who EVER has gender dysphoria diagnosis
temp |>
  tte_eligible_no_events_lifetime_before_and_after_baseline("icd10_f64")
}
