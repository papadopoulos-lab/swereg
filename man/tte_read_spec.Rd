\title{Read and validate a YAML study specification}
\usage{
tte_read_spec(spec_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec_path}{Path to the YAML specification file.}
}
\value{
A nested list representing the parsed specification, with
  `window_weeks` fields added to exclusion criteria and confounders.
}
\description{
Parses a YAML study specification file, converts human-readable windows
(e.g., "lifetime", "3 years") to weeks, and validates that all required
fields are present.
}
\details{
Window conversion rules:
\itemize{
  \item `"lifetime"` -> `Inf`
  \item `"N year"` or `"N years"` -> `N * 52`
}

Validation checks:
\itemize{
  \item Required sections: study, population, enrollments, outcomes, follow_up
  \item `study$implementation$project_prefix` must exist
  \item Each exclusion criterion must have `implementation$variable`
  \item Each outcome must have `implementation$variable`
  \item Each enrollment must have `id` and `exposure$implementation$variable`
  \item Computed confounders must have `implementation$source_variable`
}

Warns about open questions with `status: "open"`.
