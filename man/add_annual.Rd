\title{Add annual data to skeleton}
\usage{
add_annual(skeleton, data, id_name, isoyear)
}
\arguments{
\item{skeleton}{A data.table containing the main skeleton structure with id and time variables}

\item{data}{A data.table containing the annual data to be merged}

\item{id_name}{Character string specifying the name of the ID variable in the data}

\item{isoyear}{Integer specifying the ISO year for which the data applies}
}
\value{
The skeleton data.table is modified by reference with annual data merged in.
  Columns from data that already exist in skeleton will be prefixed with "i."
}
\description{
Merges annual data into the main skeleton data structure for a specific ISO year.
This function is used for adding data that is measured or recorded annually,
such as yearly income, employment status, or annual health assessments.
}
\examples{
# Load fake data
data("fake_person_ids", package = "swereg")
data("fake_annual_family", package = "swereg")
swereg::make_lowercase_names(fake_annual_family)

# Create skeleton
skeleton <- create_skeleton(fake_person_ids[1:5], "2020-01-01", "2022-12-31")

# Add annual family data for 2021
add_annual(skeleton, fake_annual_family, "lopnr", 2021)

# Check data was added only for 2021
skeleton[isoyear == 2021 & is_isoyear == TRUE, .(id, isoyear, famtyp)]
