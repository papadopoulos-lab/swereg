\title{Add 2023 MHT-specific prescription data to skeleton}
\usage{
x2026_mht_add_lmed(skeleton, lmed)
}
\arguments{
\item{skeleton}{A data.table containing the main skeleton structure}

\item{lmed}{A data.table containing prescription registry data with columns:
lopnr (ID), produkt (product name), edatum (dispensing date),
fddd (duration in days), atc (ATC code)}
}
\value{
The skeleton data.table is modified by reference with MHT treatment
  variables and approach categorizations added. Returns the modified skeleton invisibly.
}
\description{
Processes Swedish prescription registry data (LMED) specifically for the 2023
Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) study. Categorizes medications into predefined
groups, applies duration fixes, and creates treatment approach variables.
}
\details{
This function performs several steps:
\itemize{
  \item Restricts LMED data to individuals in the skeleton
  \item Categorizes products into MHT groups (A1-I2) based on product names
  \item Applies duration fixes for specific products (IUDs, minimum doses)
  \item Creates treatment approach variables based on predefined logic
  \item Handles treatment gaps and overlapping prescriptions
}
}
\note{
This function is specific to the 2023 MHT study and uses study-specific
  categorizations and approaches defined in the package data dictionary.
