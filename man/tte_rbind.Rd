\title{Combine multiple enrollment objects}
\usage{
tte_rbind(trials)
}
\arguments{
\item{trials}{A list of [TTEEnrollment] objects to combine.}
}
\value{
A new [TTEEnrollment] object with combined data.
}
\description{
Combines multiple [TTEEnrollment] objects by row-binding their data. Used for
batched processing where data is too large to fit in memory at once.
}
\details{
All trials must have the same design and data_level. The combined trial inherits:
- The design and data_level from the first trial
- The intersection of steps_completed from all trials
- The union of weight_cols from all trials
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
trials <- lapply(files, function(f) {
  tte_enrollment(load_data(f), design)$enroll(ratio = 2)
})
combined <- tte_rbind(trials)
combined$collapse(period_width = 4)$ipw()
}
