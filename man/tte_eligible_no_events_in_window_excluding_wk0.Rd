\title{Check eligibility based on no events in prior window (excluding baseline week)}
\usage{
tte_eligible_no_events_in_window_excluding_wk0(
  dt,
  event_var,
  window = 52,
  col_name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data.table with the specified event variable. Must be grouped
by person ID for proper calculation.}

\item{event_var}{Character. Name of a logical column indicating event
occurrence.}

\item{window}{Integer or Inf. Number of prior weeks to check (excluding
current week). Use `Inf` to check entire lifetime history.
Default: 52 (one year).}

\item{col_name}{Character or NULL. Name of the eligibility column to create.
If NULL, auto-generates as "eligible_no_<event_var>_<window>wk" or
"eligible_no_<event_var>_ever" for Inf window.}
}
\value{
The input data.table (invisibly), modified by reference with the new
  eligibility column.
}
\description{
Adds a logical column indicating whether there were NO TRUE values in the
specified event variable within the prior window, EXCLUDING the current
(baseline) week. This is the correct semantic for trial eligibility: we want
to know if someone had the event BEFORE they could potentially enter the trial.
}
\details{
Uses [any_events_prior_to()] internally with `.after = -1L`, which always
excludes the current row.


**Why exclude baseline week?**

In target trial emulation, eligibility is assessed at the moment of potential
trial entry. An event occurring IN the baseline week cannot be used to
determine eligibility because it happens simultaneously with (or after)
the eligibility assessment. The semantic is: "Did this person have the
event BEFORE this week?"

Using `cumsum(x) == 0` is INCORRECT because it INCLUDES the current week.
This function correctly excludes the current week.
