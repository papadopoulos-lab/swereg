\title{Calculate inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW-PP)}
\usage{
tte_calculate_ipcw(
  data,
  exposure_var,
  censoring_var,
  confounder_vars,
  id_var = "trial_id",
  tstart_var = "tstart",
  tstop_var = "tstop",
  separate_by_exposure = TRUE,
  use_gam = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table in counting-process format (one row per person per
time period). Should contain a censoring indicator column.}

\item{exposure_var}{Character, name of the baseline exposure column.}

\item{censoring_var}{Character, name of the binary censoring indicator
column (1 = censored at end of this period, 0 = not censored).}

\item{confounder_vars}{Character vector of confounder variable names for
the censoring model.}

\item{id_var}{Character, name of the trial identifier column
(default: "trial_id").}

\item{tstart_var}{Character, name of the period start time column
(default: "tstart").}

\item{tstop_var}{Character, name of the period end time column
(default: "tstop").}

\item{separate_by_exposure}{Logical, whether to fit separate censoring
models for each exposure stratum (default: TRUE). Recommended because
censoring hazards often differ by treatment.}

\item{use_gam}{Logical, whether to use GAM with smooth time term instead
of plain GLM (default: TRUE). GAM allows flexible, non-parametric time
trends in the censoring hazard.}
}
\value{
The input data.table with added columns:
  \describe{
    \item{p_censor}{Predicted probability of censoring this period}
    \item{p_uncensored}{1 - p_censor}
    \item{cum_p_uncensored}{Cumulative product of p_uncensored over time}
    \item{marginal_p}{Marginal probability of remaining uncensored at each
      time point (within exposure stratum if `separate_by_exposure = TRUE`)}
    \item{cum_marginal}{Cumulative product of marginal_p over time}
    \item{ipcw_pp}{Stabilized IPCW-PP for per-protocol analysis = cum_marginal / cum_p_uncensored}
  }
}
\description{
Calculates time-varying stabilized inverse probability of censoring weights
for per-protocol analysis in target trial emulation. IPCW-PP adjusts for
informative censoring due to protocol deviation or loss to follow-up.
}
\details{
IPCW-PP addresses informative censoring in per-protocol analysis. When people
deviate from assigned treatment or are lost to follow-up, this censoring
may be related to prognosis (sicker people may be more likely to change
treatment or die). IPCW-PP upweights people who were likely to be censored
but weren't, creating a pseudo-population where censoring is independent
of measured confounders.

**Algorithm:**
\enumerate{
  \item Fit a model for P(censored | confounders, time)
  \item Calculate conditional probability of remaining: p_uncensored = 1 - p_censor
  \item Cumulative conditional: cum_p_uncensored = cumulative product over time
  \item Marginal probability: average p_uncensored at each time (within exposure)
  \item Cumulative marginal: cumulative product of marginal probabilities
  \item Stabilized IPCW-PP = cum_marginal / cum_p_uncensored
}

Separate models by exposure are recommended because the hazard of censoring
often differs by treatment (e.g., treated patients may discontinue due to
side effects while untreated may start treatment if symptoms worsen).

GAM with smooth time term is recommended because the censoring hazard may
vary non-linearly over time.
