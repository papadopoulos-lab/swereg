\title{Run process_fn on each skeleton file via a pool of callr::r_bg() workers}
\usage{
.tte_callr_pool(files, process_fn, task, n_workers, swereg_dev_path, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{character vector of skeleton file paths}

\item{process_fn}{callback with signature `function(task, file_path)`}

\item{task}{list from [tte_plan_task()] with design, enrollment_id, age_range, n_threads}

\item{n_workers}{integer number of concurrent subprocesses}

\item{swereg_dev_path}{path to local swereg dev copy, or NULL}

\item{p}{progressor function from [progressr::progressor()]}
}
\value{
list of TTETrial objects (one per file, failures excluded with warning)
}
\description{
Launches up to n_workers concurrent subprocesses. Each subprocess loads
data.table + swereg in a fresh R session (clean OpenMP state), reads one
skeleton file, applies process_fn, and returns the TTETrial object.
