\title{Calculate inverse probability of censoring weights for per-protocol analysis}
\usage{
tte_ipcw_pp(trial, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{trial}{A [TTETrial] object with trial level data. Must have a censoring
indicator column from [tte_prepare_outcome()].}

\item{...}{Method arguments: `separate_by_exposure` (logical, default TRUE),
`use_gam` (logical, default TRUE), `censoring_var` (character or NULL).
If `censoring_var` is NULL (default), uses "censor_this_period" from
[tte_prepare_outcome()].}
}
\value{
The modified [TTETrial] object (for chaining).

\description{
S7 method that calculates IPCW-PP for informative censoring adjustment in
per-protocol analysis. Wraps [tte_calculate_ipcw()].
}
\details{
This method requires `data_level == "trial"`.


**Problem:** In a per-protocol analysis, we censor people when they deviate
from their assigned treatment or are lost to follow-up (death/emigration).
Both types of censoring may be related to prognosis - sicker people might be
more likely to start treatment or to die. This "informative censoring" biases
results.

**Solution:** At each time point, model the probability of being censored
given confounders. Upweight people who were likely to be censored but weren't,
creating a pseudo-population where censoring is independent of confounders.

**How it works (at each time period, separately for exposed/unexposed):**
\enumerate{
  \item Conditional probability: P(remain | confounders) - predicted from model
  \item Marginal probability: P(remain) - average within exposure group at that time
  \item Cumulative conditional = product of conditional probs up to this time
    (person's predicted probability of still being in study)
  \item Cumulative marginal = product of marginal probs up to this time
    (expected if censoring depended only on time and exposure, not confounders)
  \item Stabilized IPCW-PP = cumulative marginal / cumulative conditional
    (upweights people who "should have" been censored but weren't)
}

Note: This function must be run separately for each outcome because censoring
times differ by outcome (the event stops follow-up).

We fit separate models for exposed and unexposed because the hazard of
censoring (protocol deviation + loss to follow-up) may differ by treatment.
For example, unexposed individuals may be more likely to start treatment
if they develop symptoms, while exposed may be more likely to discontinue
due to side effects. GAM with smooth term s(tstop) allows flexible,
non-parametric time trends in the hazard of censoring.
