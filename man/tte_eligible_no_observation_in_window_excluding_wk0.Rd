\title{Check eligibility based on no observation of a specific value (excluding baseline week)}
\usage{
tte_eligible_no_observation_in_window_excluding_wk0(
  dt,
  var,
  value,
  window = Inf,
  col_name = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{A data.table with the specified variable. Must be grouped by
person ID for proper calculation.}

\item{var}{Character. Name of the column to check.}

\item{value}{The specific value to look for (will be compared with `==`).}

\item{window}{Integer or Inf. Number of prior weeks to check (excluding
current week). Use `Inf` to check entire lifetime history. Default: Inf.}

\item{col_name}{Character or NULL. Name of the eligibility column to create.
If NULL, auto-generates as "eligible_no_<var>_<window>wk" or
"eligible_no_<var>_ever" for Inf window.}
}
\value{
The input data.table (invisibly), modified by reference with the new
  eligibility column.
}
\description{
Adds a logical column indicating whether a specific value was NOT observed
in the specified variable within the prior window, EXCLUDING the current
(baseline) week. Useful for categorical variables where you want to exclude
people who had a specific value (e.g., "systemic_mht") in their history.
}
\details{
This is a convenience wrapper around [tte_eligible_no_events_in_window_excluding_wk0()]
that first creates a temporary logical column for whether the value was observed.

# No prior systemic MHT use (excluding baseline week)

    "rd_approach1_single", "systemic_mht", window = Inf
  )
}

}
\seealso{
[tte_eligible_no_events_in_window_excluding_wk0()] for the underlying logic,
  [tte_eligible_combine()] to combine multiple eligibility criteria
